# Introduction 
ktvn-app-debug-swing provides a debugging application for testing and resolving issues with Ktvn visual novels. It isn't 
pretty but does allow for basic testing and will be continued to be developed and improved. Swing was chosen as it 
allows testing across multiple OS without the need for platform specific solutions.
